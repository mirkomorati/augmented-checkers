# Augmented-Checkers

## Usage

- Run `game.m` file
- Choose an image from the Checkerboard folder (insert 1-20)
- Red goes first, select a pawn in the image and press a key to move it
    + `q` moves up-left
    + `e` moves up-right
    + `a` moves down-left
    + `d` moves down-right

## Todo

- More checks for move validation (don't eat all the enemy pawns)
- Better logic organization
- Multiple pawn eating (maybe a state?)
